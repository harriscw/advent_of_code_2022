# Some mild cheating on part 1 here

I dont have much prior experience with recursion and Im not very good at it.  I did give it a good attempt and wrote some pretty kludge-y code which didn't work.  After throwing in the towel a bit I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zkmyh4/comment/j026zi4) which had a compare function that was very [similar](https://topaz.github.io/paste/#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) to my kludge.  It was a helpful reference for tightening up my recursive function.  I had the main ideas down but I was stumbling on things like still needing a `return()` call after recursing, which level of loops certain code should go at, etc.  Left my kludge code in for reference.

Part 2 was pretty straight forward once it dawned on me that I had built the function to sort in part 1.
